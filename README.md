I don't mind when people interact with me  (unless stated otherwise by me or anyone im sitting with, or if you are under 15) but I am socially awkward so i may come off as nervous/quiet at first but if we talk more I gradually open up! I am also an avid overthinker so I would really appreciate lots of reassurance from friends ^_^ I also tend to hide freely when people pmo and I dont rlly like chats covering me or when its crowded, so I will tend to move if either are the case.

 My memory is also really bad so apologies if i forget who you are, it's nothing personal.

![angry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f896f9e4-b719-4f06-a5f2-2c9480d99aad) Basic dni criteria (homophobic, transphobic, racists, etc)


![angry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f896f9e4-b719-4f06-a5f2-2c9480d99aad) "Im gonna touch you" joke makers

![angry](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f896f9e4-b719-4f06-a5f2-2c9480d99aad) People who talk shit abt my friends, but especially if you talk shit, spread false rumours or hate my husband (ghostyvamps // looeytheballoon). I really don't care about any of the negative things you have to say about him.
